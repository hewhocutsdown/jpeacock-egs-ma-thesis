*What is my synthetic a priori?*

Lines of Argument
Incommensurability
Lack of episteme
Divergent adjudication process
Non-all/atheology
Failed attempts at totalization

Writing of the derivative vs. Friendly AI
Non-totalization
API
Arbitrage
Heterogeneity in politics may be a net loss; anarchism and fitness landscapes
Introduction
    Liberals in social democracies have had a difficult decade. After Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’ came not a decade of consolidated gains but rather a centrifugal scattering

My own religion
    Coup de Des
    Comte

family vs. household
polis vs. ecclesia

On Human Rights: Wole Soyinka, cf. Hannah Arendt in Werner Hamacher lecture

Postsecular and Posthuman (and Posttheist)

Plural universalities and the limits of deontology.
Probabilistic optima (vaccinations) and the limits of legal order. (System D)

Git forks and different reasons for forking (no one is superior; matter of rhetoric/politicking as to which project flourishes)
    Coalition-building
    Communities of practice come out of communities of rhetoric + coalition-building

Markets-Antimarkets and Braudel
Capitalism as Risk vs. SJ and Land

I'm an instrumentalist (pragmatist) that is nevertheless liberal even when it makes not sense to be (what society?)

I want this to be a seduction into a kind of atheological theology

Deontology: View from Nowhere, no ability to accomodate probabilistic ethics, beauty of a functional ethic with no content

Michael Taussig’s assertion that‘knowing what not to know’ is one of the most indispensable forms of social and political knowledge (Taussig 1999)

Miller's Law, dealing with liars, bullshitters, and trolls

Thesis
	We treat our ability to agree and disagree as a natural and normative state of affairs, but it's actually quite a delicate and contingent state prone to collapsing into a swarm of competing adjudication procedures. Our only exit from a war of "all against all" is through acts of faith, grounded only in a sort of naive reason, which posit a not-yet-existent common ground which may, through these very actions, form the ground they posit and produce a new episteme within which disagreement becomes possible again.
